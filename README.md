# Advanced-Eye-Tracking-and-Face-Monitoring-System
This project makes a computer program that watches a person's face and eyes in real time using a camera. It can tell if someone is looking left, right, or straight ahead. It also knows if the eyes are closed or if the head is moving too much. The program shows live video and alerts if attention is lost. It helps in keeping people focused.
